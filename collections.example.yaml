# Firestore Collections Configuration Example
# Copy this file to collections.yaml and customize for your project

collections:
  # Example: Simple collection
  - name: users
    output: ./lib/src/models
    sampleSize: 20  # Optional: number of documents to sample (default: 20)

  # Example: Collection with subcollections
  # Subcollections are nested inside parent documents (e.g., orders/{orderId}/items)
  # The tool will find a parent document and extract the subcollection schema from it
  - name: orders
    output: ./lib/src/models
    subcollections:
      - items          # Will extract from orders/{orderId}/items
      - shipping_info  # Will extract from orders/{orderId}/shipping_info

  # Example: Minimal configuration
  - name: products
    output: ./models

# Notes:
# - name: Firestore collection name (required)
# - output: Output directory for generated Dart models (required)
# - sampleSize: Number of documents to sample for type inference (optional, default: 20)
# - subcollections: List of subcollection names to also extract (optional)
